The mucosa was normal throughout the colon.  No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted.  Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation.
Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, a 6-French sheath was inserted in the right femoral artery.
Axial scans were performed from L1 to S2 and reformatted images were obtained in the sagittal and coronal planes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.
The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.  He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia.  He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious.
